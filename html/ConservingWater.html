		<h1 class="header center blue-text text-lighten-2">Conserving Water</h1>
		<h4 class="header blue-text text-lighten-2">Why is it important? </h4>
		
		<h5 class="header blue-text text-lighten-2">Water is necessary, without it everybody will die. Conserving Water can also save energy. Saving water can preserve our environment and we want to keep Earth clean as long as possible. Water is a limited resource and soon it will run out because less than 1 percent is drinkable.  </h5>
		
		<h4 class="header  blue-text text-lighten-2">Why you should save water?</h4>
		
		<h5 class="header blue-text text-lighten-2">You should save water because 97 percent of the water is salt water, we can't drink that. Only 3 percent of the water is fresh water and we can only get 1 percent of that. The Earth's population is growing and that means more people are going to need water and the amount of water is going to shrink dramatically. </h5>
  
		<h2 class="header center blue-text text-lighten-2">Tips</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Cook food in as little water as possible. This also helps it retain more nutrients.</li>
			<li>When doing laundry, match the water level to the size of the load.</li>
			<li> Shorten your shower by a minute or two and you’ll save up to 150 gallons per month.</li>
			<li>Turn off the water while you brush your teeth and save up to 4 gallons a minute. That’s up to 200 gallons a week for a family of four.</li>
			<li> Group plants with the same watering needs together to avoid overwatering some while underwatering others.</li>
			<li>Wash your pets outdoors, in an area of your lawn that needs water.</li>
			<li>Collect the water you use while rinsing fruit and vegetables. Use it to water house plants.</li>
			<li>Washing dark clothes in cold water saves water and energy, and helps your clothes retain their color.</li>
